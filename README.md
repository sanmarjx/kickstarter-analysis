# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

## Purpose
The analysis performed on this data set will help us determine how to successfully start a crowdfunding campaign for a theater play based on launch dates and campaign goals.

## Analysis
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to determine what would help us start a good crowfunding campaign for a theater play, I analyzed the outcomes of past kickstarters in relation to their launch dates. In order to do this, I created a pivot table and sorted that data by the months in which past campaigns had been launched and by the outcome - successful, failed or canceled -. Then, I created a line chart to determine when is the best time to launch the campaign.

### Outcomes Based on Goals
I also looked at the percentage of successful, failed and canceled crowdfunding campaigns based on the initial goal amount. To achieve this, I created a table that shows different dollar goal ranges and the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns that each range had. After that, I calculated the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns for each goal range. I used a line chart to show the results and observe the relation between the goal amount and the outcome.
